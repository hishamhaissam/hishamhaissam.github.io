	<h4>Project name: Over the Air (OTA) to Multiple MNOs and MVNOs</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Testing the OTA Remote File Management (RFM) and Remote Application Management (RAM) •Results: I ensure the cryptography for OTA over SMS algorithm and key length are using AES or 3DES 16 bytes/3DES 24 bytes and HTTPS TLS 1.2/1.0 protocol for OTA over HTTPS (SCP81). Also, I ensure OTA-able applets are located in independent security domains. Next, OTA keysets (KIC & KID) lengths and indexes are analyzed, along with TARs, access domain and security levels. After that, RFM and RAM are tested by sending envelopes (update file/install applet) with correct security settings during a STK session via an OTA platform. Consequently, proof of receipts (POR) are checked, and files get updated/applets get installed.</p>
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: Security Data of SIM/M2M Cards of MNOs, MVNOs and OEMs</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Assuring That SIM/M2M Cards are Compliant with the Security Guidelines •Results: I approve that the authentication and key agreement algorithms are using GSM Milenage (COMP123-4), counters’ attempts for CHVs (PINs) and PUKs are set to 0x03 and 0x0A, respectively, file system access rights are mapped on appropriate PIN/ADM codes, keysets (i.e. ADMs, KLA, KIC, KID, KIK, and Ki) are properly diversified or randomly generated card by card, telco keysets provided by MNOs/MVNOs are encrypted with a symmetric encryption and, finally, cards’ states are set to locked, OP_SECURED.</p>	
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: Logs and Traces Analysis of SIM/M2M Data Coming from MNOs, MVNOs and OEMs</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Analyzing of Logs and Traces for Different Scenarios and Different Files’ Extensions •Results: I analyze and read plenty of logs and traces received by MNOs/MVNOs for failures in: network authentication, OTA commands, STK sessions, and more. Logs I receive, mostly, use APDU commands with file extensions *.xml or *.atf, and I need to read and study the logs to figure out the root causes of issues (i.e. improper key usage, wrong TAR, wrong IMSI…etc).</p>	
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: Network Authentication for MNOs</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Verifying of Successful Authentications Between SIM/Handset and Home Subscriber Service (HSS) •Results: First, I verify 2G/3G key properties (Ki, Op and Opc), IMSI values, and ICCID values. Second, a SIM is inserted into a handset. If an authentication counter is present, I check that its value is incremented, and elementary files: LOCI, GPRSLOCI, and PSLOCI are updated, stating normal operation. Third, SMS and calls are tested. Finally, when data is available, an initiation of www session is performed.</p>	
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: SIM/M2M Applications for MNOs/MVNOs</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Making Certain That All Toolkit, Applets, Filter, Softmask, and Plug-In Are Properly Configured •Results: I assess that all applications’ AIDs are listed in EF_DIR and their applicative keys are in a dedicated security domain or in a ciphered elementary file (EF). Next, WIB/S@T menu, OTA specific functionalities, and push/pull are verified. Then, STK application positions and behavior are simulated through the navigation of the complete application tree. Finally, Store Data and Install for Install commands are validated outside SIM file system and key repositories.</p>	
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: Retrieve and Exchange of SIM/M2M Data</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Retrieving Memory Sizes and ATR, and Exchanging Data Securely •Results: I extract sizes of EEPROM, RAM, profile (MF), applications, keysets, and left-root for SIM/M2M cards. Next, I retrieve the answer to reset (ATR), supported voltage (TA3 value), and PPS (TA1 values). Finally, exchanges of sensitive data with MNOs are performed through a secured FTP protocol channel and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption.</p>	
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: Telecom and GSM Functional Tests</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Confirming That All Elementary Files in Telecom and GSM Directory Files (DFs) are Functional •Results: Using simulators and 2G/3G handsets with an active SIM: For Telecom DF, assessments are performed on SMS, SMSC, Phonebook Management, FDN, LND, BDN, SDN, MSISDN. For GSM DF, assessments are performed on LP, PLMN, FPLMN, SPN, SST, and CBMI.</p>	
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: Electrical Variables Definition</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Check and Confirm the Definition of some DP Variables. •Results: First, for ACCESS_CONTROL I verify if the variable is defined as follows: Length: 4, Format: Hexadecimal. Definition: "Access Control($IMSI<H>)(1;4)" (taking the complete IMSI length). Next, I verify sensitive variables: I verify if the sensitive alias (variables) were set as true: (ADMs, Keysets, KI, Master Keys, Milenage Keys, etc). Third, I check variables lengths making sure lengths were set in accordance to ETSI standard.</p>
	</br>
	<h4>Project name: LTE Security Data (3GPP R8)</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Check on the LTE Security Keys Compliancy. •Results: First, I check if PSK TLS key is present which can be created under Keyset40-4F and assigned in any Key Index. Then, I check its compliancy with GP22. Next, I check if DEK key is present under Keyset40-4F.  The standard defines DEK Keys Index should be plus one TLS PSK Key Index. Finally, I check whether PSK key value can be updated after personalization.</p>
	</br>
	<h4>Project name: eSIM, M2M or CE, ODC Profile Activation</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Validate the full ecosystem’s interoperability, provisioning, authentication, security, and installations for eUICC, SM-DP+ / SM-DS, LPA, and SM-DP / SM-SR for both CE and M2M offerings •Results: In step 1, I ensure an OS (i.e. ISD-R and eCASD) is loaded and a dummy ISD-P profile with only MF 3F00 is created securely at least for the M2M offering as it does not have the LPA feature. In step 2, I analyze different logs to ensure a downloaded profile is initiated by SM-SR / LPA as a request from SM-DP / SM-DP+. Also, I confirm all the ES interfaces are properly working as expected. Upon successful RSP installation, I test that MNO profile (MNO-SD) is available in eUICC. Finally, I evaluate an MNO profile can be managed remotely through OTA.</p>
		</br>
	<h4> Project name: ES2+ Interface</h4>
	<p>• Objective: I support naïve customers on testing the ES2+ between Gemalto SM-DP+ and operator for consumer GSMA offer •Results: To begin, I make sure a download order or EID allocation is done correctly. Second, I check that a confirm order is completed and an activation code is provided to a consumer. Third, a profile is released upon a successful pull request from LPA based on a correct activation code synced by a consumer.</p>
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: Hotspot / Tethering with a SIM</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Connect to a Hotspot Using a Handset's SIM •Results: First, I ensure an ADF ISIM, including EAP SIM and EAP AKA DFs references, are all present in the card, and ISIM AID is defined in EF DIR. Second, I check that an ISIM file system is personalized with IMPI/IMPU/IMS Domain. Lastly, I simply select Wi-Fi Hotspot from a handset and choose to connect through EAP SIM/AKA.</p>
		</br>
	<h4> Project name: 5G UST</h4>
	<p>• Objective: Checking on 5G Services Activation •Results: Here, in short, I ensure that 5G services in EF UST are activated based on customer requirements.</p>
		</br>
	<h4> Project name: 5G EF Files</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Evaluate 5G EF Files Presence and Structure •Results: I begin by checking DF 5GS presence and its file structure. Next, I ensure that all files relevant on services exist. Finally, I perform standard compliancy check (i.e. 31.102 R15 standard)</p>
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: 5G Authentication</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Testing the 5G LTKUP Authentication •Results: First, I check the authentication with 1st key. Second, I send SMS to activate the 2nd key. Third, I check authentication with 2nd key. Finally, I repeat 2 & 3 for all keys.</p>
		</br>
	<h4>Project name: 5G SUCI</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Testing the 5G SUCI Computation Within SIM •Results: First, I enter: MCC, MNC, SUCI type (IMSI or NAI), routing ID, protection scheme Id and Key Identifier. Second, I generate a SUCI (aka APDU Get Identity). Third, I check that all parameters are corrects. Finally, a new MSIN cryptogram is generated each time a SUCI has to be provided to a network (UDM) to avoid IMSI catchers.</p>
