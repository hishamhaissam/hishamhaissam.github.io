	<h4>Project name: Migrating Customers to NFC, Contactless, Enabled Products</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Incorporating Contactless (NFC) Features to Banks and Retails Who Are Using American Express®, VISA®, MasterCard®, and UPI® Schemes •Results: First, I design data of the contactless transmission protocol (ISO 14443, T=CL/ATS) to provide the strongest radio frequency signal. Second, I build data objects in a TLV format, PPSE directories, and data of EMV kernels for the contactless interfaces. Third, for coherency, I reconstruct the EMV data of contact interfaces along with tracks 1 and 2 data of magnetic stripes. Finally, I evaluate that NFC and contact-interface personalized data abide to the rules and specifications of payment network, EMV(Co), ISO, and GP.</p>

	<h4>Project name: Logs and Traces Analysis of Retail / Payment Cards and Terminals</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Analyzing of Logs and Traces for Different Payment and Redeem Scenarios •Results: I analyze and read plenty of logs and traces with different files’ extensions coming from different types of terminals and cards for various behaviors. I need to read and analyze traces to figure out the root causes of the issues to resolve them and/or make a better business decision</p>

	<h4>Project name: Symmetric and Asymmetric Security Keys</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Performing Key Ceremony Sessions, and Supporting in the Definition of RSA Keys •Results: I exchange symmetric security keys (KMC, IMK, AC, Integrity, IDN, Ciphering, PEK, and KEK) through key ceremonies with Issuers. In addition, at least for offline dynamic data authentication, I supported Issuers and Retailers to generate ICC and Issuer certificate keys which are the results of signatures from Issuer and CA private keys, respectively.</p>

	<h4>Project name: NFC Flexible Tag Personalization for American Express®</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Qualify and Manage the Personalization Setup of Wearable Flexible Tags Embedded in Leather Bands From Inception. •Results: As a technical consultant, I, mainly, make sure the 1.04in by 0.49in sized flexible tag with a thickness of 0.005in can be personalized by a newly established Thales personalization site. Second, I build and test the contactless ExpressPay EMV profile.  Third, I design the data processing parts. As a project manager, I, mostly, manage the internal and external meetings, validation test plans, availability of resources, progress presentations, and follow-up on a variety of technical tasks.</p>
