	<h4>Project name: IEEE Engineering Design Project</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Designing a Non-Electric Gadget to Jump Above a Barrier •Results: The idea was about designing and building a mechanical gadget that jumps over a barrier without the use of any electric component or any source of electric power. After building the gadget, I participated, solely, in an IEEE competition and won the second place.</p>

	<h4>Project name: Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS)</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Building a SHEMS to Achieve Lesser Consumptions of Money and Pollutants •Results: SHEMS utilizes renewable energy sources and controls the power coming in and out of a built environment, i.e. a building. Thus, optimizing this system results in less consumption of energy, which translates to consumers paying smaller electric bills and utilities having less power demand. Pollution is then decreased as a direct consequence of a reduction in energy consumption. Less pollution helps sustain a built environment.</p>

	<h4>Project name: Engineering and Computing Design</h4>
	<p>•Objective: Designing a Powered by Balloon Car •Results: I was the leading member of the first-place winning team in an engineering-design competition with more than five hundred competitors. The competition required participating groups to build a car powered by rubber bands or air balloons. The car must cross a ten-meter track in the shortest time possible in order to win. We won the first-place crossing ten meters in only 4.02 seconds.</p>
